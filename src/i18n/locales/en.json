    "instructionMobile": "Tap a question to see the answer",
    "q1": "Do I need WhatsApp Business API or can I use regular WhatsApp?",
    "a1": "You need WhatsApp Business API (via Twilio). It's the only way to send automated messages, use approved templates, and track delivery metrics. Regular WhatsApp doesn't support automation or campaigns.",
    "q2": "What costs do I pay vs. what's included in my plan?",
    "a2": "Your plan includes: hosting, maintenance, support, and minor updates. You pay Twilio directly for messaging costs (approx. $0.03–0.05 USD per message in the USA). This gives you full control over your WhatsApp spend.",
    "q3": "How fast is setup? What do I need to provide?",
    "a3": "Setup takes 7 business days. We just need: your logo, brand colors, product/service list with prices, and access to your WhatsApp number. We handle everything else.",
    "q4": "Can I use my own domain?",
    "a4": "Yes. We connect your existing domain (e.g., quotes.yourbusiness.com) at no extra configuration cost. You only pay for the domain if you don't already have one.",
    "q5": "Can I start simple and add automation later?",
    "a5": "Absolutely. Start with Starter and upgrade to Pro or Elite anytime. Your data stays intact and the migration is instant.",
    "q6": "What if I already have a website or CRM?",
    "a6": "ViralClicker works alongside your existing tools. We can embed the quote form on your current site, or you can use our landing page as a standalone quote funnel.",
    "q7": "Where is my data stored? Can I export it?",
    "a7": "Your data is stored securely in the cloud with enterprise-grade encryption. You can export all your leads, clients, and quotes as CSV anytime—your data is always yours.",
    "q8": "What's included in setup vs. what counts as 'minor changes'?",
    "a8": "Setup includes: landing page design, quote builder configuration, CRM setup, WhatsApp API integration, and 1-on-1 onboarding. Minor changes are small tweaks like editing text, updating form fields, or modifying WhatsApp templates—not new features or redesigns.",
    "q9": "Can I cancel anytime?",
    "a9": "Yes, no penalty. Your plan renews monthly and you can cancel anytime. We provide a full backup of your data (leads, clients, quotes).",
    "q10": "How does support work?",
    "a10": "We respond via WhatsApp and email during business hours (Monday–Friday, 9 AM–6 PM EST). Response time: under 4 hours on business days. Elite plans get priority support with under 2-hour response.",
